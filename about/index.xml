      <description>Hi there! This is my personal blog, in which I aspire to share stuff that I find interesting. I am a systems researcher, working on the lower-level parts of the stack to attack issues related to performance, scalability, power-efficiency and security in hypervisors. Previously, I was a Post-doc at CSLab, NTUA, working on bridging the gap between common HPC practices and virtualization. My research interests include I/O Virtualization, systems software for high-performance I/O in virtualized environments, systems support for heterogeneous platforms, communication architectures for clusters, and scalable storage architectures based on clusters.</description>
